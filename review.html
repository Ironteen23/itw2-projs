                Club Is Clean And Well Kept. Group Trainers Are Enthusiastic, Engaging And Well Prepared. I Love That
                You Have ‘More Mature’ Trainers... Makes For Great Role Models

                This Is A Fantastic Gym!! All The Trainers Are Super Nice And Take An Interest In You No Matter What
                Fitness Level You’re At. I Really Like How They Give Me Tips And Tricks To Get The Most Out Of Every
                Workout. I’ve Been Going For A Little Bit And Am Already Seeing A Big Change In My Energy Levels And
                Body. It’s Great! I Feel 10 Years Younger!

                My First Experience With This GYM Is Awesome And Have Not Been Disappointed! I Train Here About 4-5 Times A Week And Find The Consistent Positive Trainers, Awesome Music And Participants Who Take Class Create A Perfect Workout Environment. I Love That They Provide Parking Validation, Towels For Workouts, Water And Most Importantly The Same Group Of Quality Trainers Are There To Personally Get To Know You And Push You In The Right Way. It’s A Hard Workout With Happy People! And I Am Seeing Results For Sure.

                The Workouts Are Fun, The Fellow Members Are Inspiring, The Workouts Are Led By Personal Trainers Who Give Hands On Instant Feedback And Adjustments During The Workouts And Just The Right Amount Of Encouragement. The Music Is Blaring And The Atmosphere Is Awesome. You Will Not Do The Same Workout Twice And If You Go You Will See The Results No Question. It’s A Life Changing Gym Experience And I Recommend It Highly To All My Fiends And Family.

                Good Mix Of Functional Fitness With Traditional Gym Equipment. Lots Of Space For Olympic Lifting Too. Unless You’re Here In The Early Morning Or The Evening, There Are Never Too Many People Which Is Nice. There Are Classes Offered In The Morning, At Noon And In The Evening – Good, Varied Range Of Different Options.
